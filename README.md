# Overview

I wrote a web app that uses NodeJS to display a top 10 movie list. It displays 10 thumbnails of movies and if one is clicked, it produces more information.

My purpose for creating this software is to learn the basics of using NodeJS. I have a lot to learn, but this was a beginning into the world of NodeJS.

# Web Pages

The web page html is only the structure of the page. All of the content and information is displayed using JavaScript and is interactive.

There is a search bar that takes user input, finds movies that match, then has the same functionality.

# Development Environment

I used VS Code and NodeJS to create this small web app.

I used HTML and JavaScript (NodeJS). To style the page, I used Bootstrap.

# Useful Websites

* [W3 Schools - Node JS](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/)
* [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/)

# Future Work

* In the future, I could add another page that could add and remove movies from the list.
* I need to research how to include seperate JavaScript files. In this project I had to put all my JavaScript in script tags within the html file.
* I can figure out how to better include more NodeJS and become more well versed in the software.
